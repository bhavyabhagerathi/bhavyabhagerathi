- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Bhavya, a passionate data science enthusiast and recent graduate diving into the exciting realms of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As a fresher, I'm on a journey to explore, learn, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of data science.

- ðŸš€ Currently, my GitHub is a canvas where I paint my projects in the fields of data science, AI, and ML. From predictive modeling to natural language processing, I'm fascinated by the possibilities these technologies offer. My goal? To blend theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience and share the insights gained along the way.

- ðŸŒ± If you're as intrigued by the endless possibilities of data as I am, let's connect! Together, we can explore the data-driven universe and turn ideas into impactful solutions.
